**GreenPrint** is an interactive tool designed to help you measure your **carbon footprint** 

---

### 🔍 What is a Carbon Footprint?

Your **carbon footprint** is the total amount of **greenhouse gases** released into the air because of your daily life.

Everyday things like:

- 🏠 **Using energy at home** (heating, electricity)
- 🚗 **Getting around** (cars, buses, flights)
- 🍔 **What you eat** (especially meat and dairy)
- 🛍️ **What you buy and throw away** (clothes, electronics, waste)

It's measured in **kg of CO₂ equivalent (CO₂e)** — a standard way to show how much impact your actions have on climate change.

---

### 🚨 Why It Matters

The higher our carbon footprint, the more we contribute to climate change. By understanding your own emissions, you can:

- Reduce your environmental impact  
- Save money through efficient choices  
- Join the global effort to combat the climate crisis  

---

### 🛠️ How This App Works

1. Go to the **Profile** page and create your profile, which brings you directly to the **Calculator** and enter details about your daily habits.  
2. Get an estimate of your **annual carbon footprint**.  
3. Compare your score to **national and global averages**.  
4. See personalized suggestions on how to **reduce** it.
